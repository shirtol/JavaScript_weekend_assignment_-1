## Description

This task includes exercises in JS.
In order to solve the exercises I had to use JS string, object and array APIs, such as filter, map, split, slice etc.
During this task I also had to solve some algorithmic challanges, such as binary search and fibonacci sequence (using a for loop, recursion, recursion and memoization).

## Main Technologies:

-   JS

### Testing:

-   mocha
-   chai
-   VS code mocha test explorer

## Instructions:

-   In order to run each exercise: In the command line (from the exercise folder) run `node *fileName*.js`
-   In order to run all tests: In the command line (from the main repo folder) run `npm test`
-   Note: if you want to run each test separately use [mocha test explorer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-mocha-test-adapter).
